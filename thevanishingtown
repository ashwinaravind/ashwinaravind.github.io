## Chunk 1: The Stranger in the Forest

The wind howled through the ancient pines as Clara trudged deeper into the forest. The sun was setting, casting long shadows that danced around her like silent ghosts. She had no choice but to keep going. Behind her, the village was no longer safe. They had accused her of witchcraft. All because of a dream she had told the wrong person.

Clara clutched the silver locket around her neck, the only thing her mother had left her before she disappeared ten years ago. It was her most treasured possession, though she had never been able to open it. The ornate, delicate clasp seemed almost fused shut. Her mother had told her it was a family heirloom, something that would protect her in times of need. She didn’t know how that could be true now, as she ran, hunted.

Just before dusk, Clara stumbled upon a small clearing. In the center stood a dilapidated cabin. Exhausted and with nowhere else to go, she approached. The door creaked open with the softest push, revealing a dusty, abandoned space. She slumped down against the cold stone hearth, staring blankly at the flickering fire she had somehow managed to start.

As she drifted to sleep, a figure appeared in her mind—tall, with piercing green eyes. His face was unfamiliar, but something about him felt disturbingly close. He spoke her name softly, just before she awoke with a start.

The fire had burned out. And she was no longer alone.

## Chunk 2: The Old Cabin

It had been years since Marek had dared to return to the cabin. His father had warned him never to come back after what happened to their family. But the dreams—the dreams were relentless now, drawing him back to the forest. The same cabin appeared night after night. A figure standing in the clearing. He could never make out her face, but she was always waiting for him.

The cabin held dark memories for Marek. His mother had disappeared in the forest when he was only a boy. His father said she’d gone mad, claiming their family was cursed, but Marek knew better. He had seen things, even as a child—strange figures in the woods, whispers that came with the wind. And the locket. His mother always wore that locket.

Marek reached the edge of the clearing just as night began to fall. The air felt heavy with an unspoken tension. The cabin was as he remembered it—broken, abandoned, a ghost from his past. He approached cautiously, his breath steady, but his heart racing.

As he neared the door, it creaked slightly, as if someone had been inside. He gripped the hilt of his dagger, more out of instinct than fear. Stepping into the cabin, he saw the outline of a figure curled by the hearth.

A young woman.

## Chunk 3: The Locket’s Secret

Clara awoke to a sound—footsteps. Her eyes shot open. In the dim light, she saw a man standing at the door, silhouetted against the night. His green eyes gleamed in the shadows.

“I didn’t think anyone else knew about this place,” she said quietly, gripping the silver locket hanging around her neck.

The man’s gaze shifted to the locket, his expression growing hard. “That locket,” he said softly, almost a whisper. “I haven’t seen one like it in years. My mother used to wear one just like it… before she vanished.”

Clara’s breath caught. She had never met anyone else with a locket like hers. Could it be…? But she pushed the thought away. “It was my mother’s too,” she replied, her voice steady despite the unease creeping into her chest. “She disappeared when I was a child. Left this behind.”

The man stepped closer, eyes narrowing. “Disappeared, you say? Into these very woods, I suppose.”

Clara hesitated. How could he know? But she only nodded. The locket suddenly felt heavier, like a weight pressing into her skin. She could see the flicker of recognition in the man’s eyes. Yet, neither of them spoke the words that hovered between them.

Instead, the man turned and walked toward the door. “There are some things best left forgotten,” he muttered, just loud enough for her to hear. “Hold on to that locket, but don’t dig too deep into its history.”

With that, he disappeared into the night, leaving Clara alone, clutching the locket as though her life depended on it.
